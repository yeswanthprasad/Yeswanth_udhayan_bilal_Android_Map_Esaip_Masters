# Yeswanth_udhayan_bilal_Android_Map_Esaip_Masters


We created an Android Project which is interfaced with the Google map 
where one can search a place 
one can add,view,delete edit the places. 
The dates where stored in sqlite database . 
Moreover there are additional options like satellite view, Hybrid view, Terrine view, normal view. 
In this we have used 
Fragments
Intent 
ListViews
Options
Google map Api
Database Sqlite
Animated camera
showing location using latitude and longitude 
zooming options
Async task is implemented for fragments.
We used the Emulator :  Galaxy_Nexus_API_24:5554.
